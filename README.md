Achieved 98% accuracy in predicting handwritten digits by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Python, incorporating multiple Conv2D, max-pooling, dropout, flatten, and dense layers for optimal feature extraction and classification. Preprocessed and normalized image data, implemented model training with categorical crossentropy loss, and evaluated performance to prevent overfitting. Developed a Django web application to integrate the model, enabling real-time digit classification through a streamlined backend API. Implemented a canvas using Fabric.js in the frontend, allowing users to draw digits and submit them for prediction.
